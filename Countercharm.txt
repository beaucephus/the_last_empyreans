====== Countercharm ======
Created Sunday 20 September 2020

As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn.
During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.
A creature must be able to hear you.
The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it.
