Abraxas Asmodei was always faster with his tongue than with a dagger, and always looking for a racket to run.
His mother being sickly, and his father poor, they didn't have much, and Abraxas swore to himself he wouldn't suffer the same life they had.
From the sparkling highways of upper Luxendarc down to the dank catacombs of the nest, Abraxas swindled, gambled, and cheated so that he and his family could survive.
Eventually, his habits caught up with him when he conned a Luxendarcian noble, Lord Farah, out of a few too many silver.
Lord Farah would have had Abraxas hanged, but the courts ruled in Abraxas' favor and he was sent into exile instead.

Now Abraxas roams the free lands searching for friends, companions, someone who might have his back if his habits catch up to him again.
